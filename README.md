## About Project

YouTube-inspired website built using React JS, TypeScript and designed using Tailwind CSS. Website is fully responsive and uses reusable components that take certain props. The entire website is based on fetching data using Axios from Rapid API. It allows to search for movies and channels by popular categories or by phrases typed into the searchbar. Thanks to React Player, videos can be watched as on YouTube. Each video has its own dynamically generated page that, in addition to the video itself, also contains its statistics and related videos. Each channel also has its own dynamically generated page, which contains the channel's statistics and the videos shared on it.
